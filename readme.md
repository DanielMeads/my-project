![test workflow](https://github.com/DanielMeads/my-project/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml/badge.svg)

In order to deploy a continuous deployment pipeline between the code hosted on my local machine to github then to a digital ocean droplet, I have made use of github workflows working on a yaml file that detects when a series of tests have been passed. Once it has done so it continues to gain access to the droplet through a series of secrets (ssh Key, Host name, and passphrase) to the droplet which then runs a .sh script hosted there. The .sh script accesses github which has remote access and pulls the information hosted on github to the server before restarting the program and printing a confirmation message.

I encountered a couple of issues when setting up this pipeline, the first was an issue of finding the code to implement the YAML file, as this was a whole new syntax to learn for implementation. It tooks several iterations to get it operating correctly as the indentation on those files is different to python and I had repeated failures due to spaces being in the wrong place and altering the hierarchy of the code. A simple is frustrating issue to the code.

The next issue was with the ssh key from the digital ocean droplet as I was copying and pasting it from the terminal, this introduced several line breaks that were interrupting the code. Eventually I exported this key to a text document and manually adjusted it.

One final issue is the delay on the updating, a minor issue but due to the codepipeline requiring the following step to have the correct information to run. I.E. github needs the correct YAML and PYTEST before it can be updated and checked and the droplet requires the .sh file before it can run the file. It means that implementing these were at the first point manual and future updates to them through the pipeline will be one version behind. I.E. Updating the YAML, TEST, and SH files check the previous implementation before updating to the new version.
